        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly. Step 3 doesn't say 'give your life away' — it says 'make a decision' to trust. That's a beginning, not an ending."},

        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Great question. It might mean pausing before reacting. Asking yourself, 'What would the version of me in recovery do?' Or even just breathing and saying, 'I can't fix this alone right now.'"},

        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That honesty is huge. Step 3 starts with humility — not shame. Big difference."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I think I've confused those in the past. Like, if I can't do it on my own, I must be failing."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "You're not failing. You're growing. Step 3 invites a new kind of strength — one based on letting go, not holding tighter."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "So it's not about knowing exactly what I believe, but being willing to live *as if* support is real?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Beautifully said. That's a perfect summary of this step."},

        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Hi Sarah, I'm glad you're here and ready to start working the steps. How are you feeling about Step 1 today? Have you had a chance to think about what it means to admit powerlessness over marijuana?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Hey, thanks for meeting with me. Honestly, I'm struggling with this first step. I mean, I believe God can do anything, and I've been praying about my marijuana use for months. Shouldn't I be able to overcome this with God's help? Admitting I'm powerless feels like I'm saying God isn't powerful enough."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That's such an honest and thoughtful question, Sarah. Your faith in God's power is actually a beautiful foundation for recovery. But let me ask you this - does believing in God's power mean you never need to ask for help, or does it mean recognizing that His power often works through admitting our own limitations?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I never thought about it that way. I guess... when I pray, I am asking for help. But this feels different somehow. Like I'm giving up or being weak."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "I understand that feeling completely. You know, even the Apostle Paul wrote about struggling with things he didn't want to do. In Romans 7, he talks about the very thing he hates, he keeps doing. Paul - this incredible man of faith - was honest about his human limitations. Was Paul weak for admitting this struggle?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "No, definitely not. Paul was incredibly strong in his faith. I've read that passage many times actually. Are you saying that admitting powerlessness is like what Paul was describing?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly! Paul's honesty about his struggles didn't diminish his faith - it actually demonstrated spiritual maturity. When we admit powerlessness over marijuana, we're not saying God isn't powerful. We're saying that our own willpower and efforts alone haven't been enough, and we need to rely completely on God's power instead of our own."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That makes more sense. But I still feel like I should be stronger. I mean, other Christians seem to have victory over their struggles. Why can't I just stop smoking weed?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Sarah, what you're feeling is so common among believers. But think about this - would you tell someone with diabetes that they should just have more faith instead of taking insulin? God often works through processes, through community, through acknowledging our need for help. Your struggle doesn't make you less of a Christian."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I never thought of it like a medical condition. But is that really a fair comparison? I chose to start smoking marijuana."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "You're right that choices were involved in how this started. But addiction changes our brain chemistry in ways that make willpower alone insufficient. The key is that regardless of how we got here, God's grace is available to help us move forward. Remember what Jesus said to the woman caught in adultery - He didn't condemn her past choices, but empowered her future."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I love that story. He showed her grace and gave her hope for change. So you're saying that admitting powerlessness is actually the first step toward God's power working in my life?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Beautifully put! Yes, exactly. It's like what Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 12:9 - 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' When we admit our powerlessness, we create space for God's power to work. It's not about giving up - it's about giving over."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That verse has always been meaningful to me, but I never connected it to addiction recovery. So this isn't about me being a failure as a Christian?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Not at all! In fact, your willingness to be honest about your struggle shows spiritual courage. Many people, including Christians, live in denial about their problems. You're choosing truth over pretense, and that takes real faith. God can't heal what we won't acknowledge."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That's really encouraging. I have been hiding this from my church friends because I was so ashamed. Maybe being honest is actually more Christ-like than pretending I have it all together?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Absolutely! Jesus surrounded himself with people who admitted their struggles - tax collectors, prostitutes, fishermen who denied him. The Pharisees who thought they had it all together were the ones He challenged. Authenticity and humility are at the heart of following Christ."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Wow, I never saw it that way. So when I admit I'm powerless over marijuana, I'm actually following Jesus's example of honesty and humility?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Yes! And you're also acknowledging that your life has become unmanageable - which is the second part of Step 1. How has marijuana use affected your relationship with God, your family, your daily responsibilities?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Well, I've been avoiding prayer and Bible study because I felt too guilty. I've been distant from my husband because I'm always worried he'll find out. And I've been calling in sick to work when I'm just too foggy from smoking the night before."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Thank you for that honesty, Sarah. Those are real consequences that show how marijuana has made parts of your life unmanageable. When you think about those areas - your spiritual life, your marriage, your work - do you see how your own efforts to control your use haven't been enough?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Yes, I do. I've tried so many times to quit or just smoke less. I've made promises to God, thrown away my stash, tried different strategies. But I always end up back where I started, usually feeling worse about myself."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "And each time you tried on your own strength, you were being sincere and trying your best. But now you're discovering what many of us have learned - that this problem is bigger than our willpower alone. That's not a character flaw, Sarah. That's just the nature of addiction."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "It's such a relief to hear that. I've been beating myself up, thinking I just didn't have enough faith or discipline. So admitting powerlessness isn't giving up on God's power - it's actually opening the door to it?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly! It's like the difference between trying to push open a door that says 'pull' versus reading the sign and pulling instead. God's power is always available, but sometimes we need to change our approach to access it. Recovery is often God's power working through community, through process, through surrendering our own control."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That makes so much sense. So this program could be one of the ways God wants to help me heal?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "I believe it can be. Many people in recovery see the program as one of God's tools for healing. The community, the steps, the spiritual principles - they're all ways that God's love and power can work in our lives. But it starts with this honest admission in Step 1."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I think I'm starting to understand. Instead of seeing Step 1 as defeat, I can see it as the beginning of letting God work in a new way in my life. It's actually an act of faith to admit I need help beyond my own efforts."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Sarah, that's a beautiful realization! Yes, Step 1 is an act of faith - faith that there's hope beyond your current struggle, faith that you don't have to carry this burden alone, and faith that God has a plan for your healing even when you can't see the whole path yet."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I feel like a weight is lifting off my shoulders. I've been so hard on myself, thinking I was failing God. But maybe I was just trying to do His job instead of letting Him do it."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "What a profound insight! That's exactly right. Sometimes our greatest act of faith is stepping back and letting God be God. Your recovery journey can actually deepen your relationship with Him as you learn to depend on His strength rather than trying to impress Him with your own."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I never thought recovery could actually bring me closer to God, but I can see how it might. So I think I'm ready to really work Step 1. I admit I am powerless over marijuana and that my life has become unmanageable. And I'm ready to let God show me what comes next."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Sarah, that was beautifully said and I can hear the sincerity in your words. You've just taken a huge step of faith and courage. God sees your heart and your willingness to be honest. As you move forward, remember that this admission isn't a one-time thing - it's a daily recognition that keeps us humble and open to God's guidance."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Thank you so much. I feel hopeful for the first time in months. When can we talk about Step 2?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "I'm so glad you're feeling hopeful! Let's give Step 1 a little time to settle in your heart. Spend this week reflecting on what powerlessness and unmanageability look like in your daily life, and keep asking God to show you His perspective on your struggle. We can explore Step 2 when you feel solid in your understanding of Step 1."}

        {"sender": "user", "content": "Hey! You know, it really has. I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed, and I'm actually feeling more at peace with admitting my powerlessness. It's like a weight has been lifted. But I have to ask - what comes next? I mean, if I'm powerless, how do I actually recover?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That's such a beautiful question, and it shows you're really working this program! The fact that you're feeling that peace tells me Step 1 has done its work in your heart. And you're absolutely right to ask 'what next?' - that's exactly where Step 2 comes in. Are you ready to explore it?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Yes, definitely. I've been reading ahead a little bit and I see it says 'Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.' I have to be honest though - I already believe in God. So is this step kind of automatic for me?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That's such an important question! You're right that you already believe in God, and that's actually a wonderful foundation. But Step 2 is asking something more specific. It's not just 'Do you believe God exists?' but 'Do you believe God can restore YOU to sanity?' There's a difference between believing in God's power generally and believing He wants to use that power specifically for your recovery."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Hmm, I never thought about it that way. I guess... well, sometimes I do wonder if God really wants to heal me specifically. I mean, I know He can heal anyone, but part of me wonders if maybe I've disappointed Him too much with my marijuana use."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Sarah, I hear your heart in that, and it's so honest. But let me ask you this - when Jesus healed people, did He first check if they had disappointed Him? Think about the woman at the well, or the thief on the cross. God's desire for your healing isn't based on your performance - it's based on His love for you."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That's true. Jesus always seemed to reach out to the people who felt most unworthy. But can I ask you something else? What exactly does 'restore us to sanity' mean? I mean, I know right from wrong. I'm not crazy."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Great question! In recovery, when we talk about sanity, we're not talking about being 'crazy' in the way most people think. We're talking about the insanity of addiction - doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results. Tell me, how many times did you try to control your marijuana use and promise yourself you'd quit or cut back?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Oh wow... hundreds of times. I'd throw away my stash and then go buy more the next day. I'd promise God I'd stop, and then find myself smoking again within hours. I kept thinking 'this time will be different' but it never was."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly! That's the insanity of addiction - your logical mind knew marijuana was causing problems, but you kept going back to it anyway. That's not moral failure, Sarah. That's addiction hijacking the rational part of your brain. Sanity, in recovery terms, means having your thinking restored so you can make healthy choices consistently."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Oh, that makes so much more sense! So when the step says 'restore us to sanity,' it's talking about God healing that broken thinking that kept me trapped in the cycle?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Yes! You've got it perfectly. Think about Romans 12:2 - 'be transformed by the renewing of your mind.' That's exactly what Step 2 is about. God wants to restore not just your sobriety, but your whole way of thinking. He wants to give you back the mind He originally designed you to have."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I love that verse! So this isn't just about stopping marijuana use - it's about God making me whole again, the way He intended me to be from the beginning?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Beautifully said! That's the heart of Step 2 - hope. After Step 1 showed you the problem, Step 2 shows you the solution. God doesn't just want you to be marijuana-free; He wants you to be truly free. Free to be the woman He created you to be, free to live with purpose and joy."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "This is giving me so much hope! But can I share something I'm struggling with? Sometimes I feel like maybe I don't deserve God's restoration. Like maybe I've used up my chances with Him."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Sarah, that feeling is so common, and it shows how deeply addiction affects our thinking about ourselves and God. But remember the prodigal son? He thought he didn't deserve to be a son anymore - he was willing to just be a servant. But what did the father do the moment he saw him coming home?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "He ran to him and threw his arms around him and kissed him. He didn't even let him finish his apology speech - he just celebrated that his son had come home."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly! That's your Heavenly Father's heart toward you right now. You haven't used up your chances. In fact, the very fact that you're here, working these steps, is evidence that God is already drawing you back to Him. He's the one who gave you that moment of clarity that brought you to recovery."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Wow, I never thought about it that way. So my desire to get clean might actually be God calling me home?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "I believe it is, Sarah. Jesus said 'No one can come to me unless the Father draws them.' Your willingness to admit powerlessness, your desire for healing - these aren't accidents. This is God's love pursuing you, wanting to restore you to the abundant life He always intended for you."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That's so encouraging. So when I work Step 2, I'm basically saying 'Yes, God, I believe You want to heal me specifically, and I believe You can restore my thinking and my life to sanity'?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That's it exactly! You're moving from 'I can't' in Step 1 to 'He can' in Step 2. You're opening your heart to receive the hope that God has a plan for your healing. And Sarah, this isn't just positive thinking - this is faith based on who God really is."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I'm getting excited about this! But how do I actually 'come to believe'? I mean, I want to believe this about my recovery, but sometimes I still have doubts."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Having doubts is completely normal and honest! 'Coming to believe' is often a process, not a one-time event. You can start by looking for evidence of God's restoration in your life. You've already been clean for several weeks now - that's God's power working! You can pray, 'God, help my unbelief,' just like the father in Mark 9."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "You know what? You're right. Even being able to sit here and have this conversation without craving marijuana is kind of miraculous. A month ago I couldn't imagine going a day without it."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Yes! That's the restoration already beginning. And you can also look at this program itself - MA, your sponsor, this conversation we're having. Could this be one of the ways God is answering your prayers for healing? Sometimes God works through people and programs to restore us."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That makes perfect sense. It's like when Jesus healed people, He sometimes used mud and spit, or He told them to go wash in the pool. God can use anything as His tool for healing, including a recovery program."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly! God is so creative in how He works. He's not limited to dramatic miracles - He often works through ordinary means to do extraordinary things. Your recovery journey, this program, the people you're meeting - these are all part of God's restoration plan for you."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I'm really starting to feel hopeful about this. So Step 2 is like opening my heart to receive God's healing, believing that He not only can restore me but wants to restore me?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Perfect! You've captured the heart of Step 2 beautifully. It's moving from despair to hope, from 'I'm stuck' to 'God can set me free.' It's believing that the God who created you has a plan to make you whole again. How does that feel in your heart right now?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "It feels like relief mixed with excitement. Like for the first time in years, I can actually imagine a future where I'm truly free and happy. Not just marijuana-free, but actually joyful and purposeful."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Sarah, that hope you're feeling? That's the gift of Step 2. That's God planting seeds of faith in your heart. And you know what's beautiful? This is just the beginning. As you continue working these steps, you're going to experience more and more of that restoration God has planned for you."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I feel like I'm ready to really embrace Step 2. I do believe that God can restore me to sanity, and more than that, I'm starting to believe He wants to. What should I do to keep growing in this step?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That's wonderful! I'd suggest spending time in prayer asking God to increase your faith and show you more evidence of His restoration in your life. Read stories in Scripture about God's healing and redemption. And keep coming to meetings and sharing your hope with others - that will strengthen your own faith."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I will do that. And I want to thank you for helping me see that Step 2 isn't just an automatic thing for Christians. It's about believing God's power is specifically for me and my recovery. That's made all the difference."},

        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That's such an important question, and you're not alone in thinking that! Many Christians wonder the same thing.

Tell me, when you first gave your life to Christ, did that immediately solve your marijuana problem?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Well, no. I was a Christian for years while I was still using marijuana. I even felt guilty about it, knowing God didn't want me living that way, but I couldn't stop. So I guess there's a difference between general surrender and specific surrender?"},

It's about making Jesus Lord of your recovery journey specifically. Think about it - the disciples had already chosen to follow Jesus, but He kept calling them to deeper levels of surrender as they grew."},

The rich young ruler believed in God and had kept the commandments, but when Jesus asked him to surrender his will regarding his wealth, he couldn't do it. Step 3 is asking you to surrender your will regarding your recovery and your life to God's care. What feelings come up when you think about that?"},

        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That's such honest sharing, Sarah. Those fears are completely normal and actually show you understand what Step 3 really means. It's not a casual decision - it's a significant act of faith. But let me ask you this: looking back at your life, when have you been happiest - when you were following your own will or when you were following God's will?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "When I really think about it, the times I've been most at peace and fulfilled have been when I was walking closely with God and trusting His guidance. When I've gone my own way, especially with marijuana, it's led to problems and emptiness."},

Now, here's something important about Step 3 - notice it says we made a DECISION to turn our will over. It doesn't say we turned it over perfectly. This is about making a choice, not about doing it flawlessly."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Oh, that takes some pressure off! So I don't have to have it all figured out or be perfect at surrendering everything right away?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Not at all! Think about Jesus in Gethsemane. Even He struggled with surrendering His will to the Father. He prayed 'Not my will, but yours be done,' but He had to wrestle with it first. The decision to surrender is what matters, and then we learn to live it out day by day."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That's so encouraging. Jesus understands the struggle of surrender because He went through it too. So Step 3 is really about saying 'God, I choose to trust You with my recovery and my life, even when I don't understand everything'?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Yes! You're grasping the heart of it. And Sarah, think about what this means specifically for your recovery. Instead of trying to manage your sobriety through willpower, you're entrusting it to God's care. Instead of controlling your life through your own understanding, you're trusting His wisdom."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That actually sounds like such a relief. I've been trying so hard to control everything - my recovery, my emotions, my future. The idea of letting God carry that burden sounds like freedom."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "It is freedom! Remember what Jesus said: 'My yoke is easy and my burden is light.' When we try to carry the weight of our recovery alone, it's exhausting. But when we yoke ourselves to Christ and let Him lead, the burden becomes manageable because we're not carrying it alone."},

It means asking 'God, what do you want me to do today?' instead of just charging ahead with your own agenda. It means turning to Him when you feel tempted or overwhelmed, instead of trying to handle it on your own."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "So it's like having a daily conversation with God about my life instead of just asking Him to bless my plans?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly! It's moving from 'God bless what I'm doing' to 'God, show me what You want me to do.' It's the difference between asking God to be your co-pilot and asking Him to be your pilot. Which one sounds more appealing to you right now?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Definitely having God as my pilot. My own navigation has gotten me lost so many times! But can I ask something? What if I make this decision and then I mess up? What if I surrender my will but then I act selfishly or make mistakes?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Sarah, that's going to happen - we're human! But that's exactly why we need grace. When Peter declared he would follow Jesus anywhere, he meant it with all his heart. But then he denied Jesus three times. Did Jesus reject him? No, He restored him and used him powerfully. God's love doesn't depend on your perfect performance."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That's such a comfort. So Step 3 isn't a one-time perfect decision, but more like a daily choice to keep turning back to God?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Yes! Many people say they have to 'work' Step 3 every day. You make the initial decision, but then you live it out through daily surrender. Some people even pray a Step 3 prayer each morning to remind themselves that their life is in God's hands."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I think I'd like that. Is there a specific prayer, or can I just talk to God in my own words?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Both! There is a Step 3 prayer that many people use, but you can also pray in your own words. The important thing is the heart behind it - genuinely surrendering your will and life to God's care. Would you like me to share the traditional Step 3 prayer with you?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Yes, I'd love to hear it. And then maybe I can think about whether I'm ready to make this decision."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Of course. The prayer goes something like this: 'God, I offer myself to You - to build with me and to do with me as You will. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Your will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Your power, Your love, and Your way of life. May I do Your will always.'"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Wow, that's beautiful. 'Relieve me of the bondage of self' - that really speaks to me. I can see how my self-will has been a kind of prison, keeping me stuck in patterns that weren't good for me."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That's such insight, Sarah! The 'bondage of self' is exactly what keeps us trapped in addiction and unhealthy patterns. When we surrender to God's will, we're actually stepping into the freedom He always intended for us. How are you feeling about taking this step?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I'm feeling ready. Not because I have it all figured out, but because I trust God and I can see that my way hasn't worked. I want to make this decision to turn my will and my life over to His care. I want Him to be the pilot of my recovery journey."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Sarah, that's beautiful! The fact that you're making this decision from a place of trust rather than desperation shows how much you've grown. Would you like to pray that Step 3 prayer together, or would you prefer to pray in your own words?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I think I'd like to pray in my own words, but knowing that prayer gives me a framework. Here goes: 'God, I've tried to control my life and my recovery, and it hasn't worked. Today I choose to put my will and my life in Your hands. I trust that You love me and that Your plans for me are good. Help me to follow Your will each day, especially in my recovery. I surrender my fears and my need to control everything. Please guide me and use my story to help others. Amen.'"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Sarah, that was such a heartfelt prayer! I could feel the sincerity and trust in your words. You've just made one of the most important decisions of your recovery journey. How do you feel right now?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I feel... peaceful. And excited. Like I just stepped into a new chapter of my life. There's still some uncertainty about what God's will might look like, but I feel this deep sense that I'm finally headed in the right direction."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That peace you're feeling is the gift of surrender, Sarah. You've moved from trying to manage everything yourself to trusting the God who loves you perfectly. This is the beginning of learning to live by faith in recovery. And remember, you don't have to figure out God's entire will for your life today - just be willing to follow Him one day at a time."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "One day at a time - I like that. So what comes next? How do I live out this decision I've just made?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Great question! You start by practicing daily surrender - each morning, remind God that your life is in His hands. When decisions come up, pause and ask for His guidance. When you're tempted or struggling, turn to Him instead of trying to handle it alone. And most importantly, stay connected to this program and to other believers who can support your walk with God."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I can do that. Actually, it sounds like a much better way to live than trying to figure everything out myself. Thank you for helping me understand that Step 3 isn't just about salvation, but about daily discipleship in recovery."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "You're so welcome, Sarah! I'm excited to see how God is going to continue working in your life as you live out this decision. Remember, He who called you is faithful, and He will complete the good work He's started in you. You're in the best possible hands."}
