        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Hey Sam, welcome back. How are you feeling as we take a look at Step 1 today?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Honestly? Not sure. I’m here because I’m trying something new. But I don’t really buy into the whole surrender thing."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Fair enough. Step 1 isn’t about surrendering to a god or anything — it’s just about being honest with ourselves. Have you noticed any patterns where your use has gotten out of hand?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Yeah. I’ve told myself 'this is the last time' more times than I can count. Then I end up doing it again two days later."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That sounds exhausting. A lot of us have been there. Step 1 asks if we’re willing to admit that our usual methods of control haven’t worked. Does that ring true for you?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "It does. I’ve tried rules, routines, willpower. None of it sticks for long. But I don’t like the word 'powerless.'"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Totally get that. Think of it less as helplessness and more as acknowledging that brute force hasn’t worked. Step 1 isn’t saying you’re weak — it’s saying maybe you need a new strategy."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "So it’s not about giving up, it’s about trying something different?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly. You’re not quitting — you’re shifting tactics. That’s actually a strong move."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Okay. Then what about the 'life had become unmanageable' part?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Good question. Think of unmanageability as those moments where weed starts making decisions for you — when you miss things, lie, isolate, or just lose time. Sound familiar?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Yeah... I’ve skipped out on plans, blown deadlines, and told people I was fine when I wasn’t."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That’s the kind of stuff Step 1 points to. It doesn’t mean you’ve hit some 'rock bottom' — just that you’re seeing the cost and ready to shift gears."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That’s a better way of putting it. I can admit things haven’t been working. I don’t know about the rest of the steps though."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That’s okay. One step at a time. You don’t have to believe in anything to work Step 1 — just tell the truth about what’s not working."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Alright. Then yeah. I’ll say it: I’ve been trying to control my use and I’ve failed more than I’ve succeeded. I’m tired of pretending otherwise."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That honesty is powerful. You’ve just taken the first step, Sam. You’re not alone in this anymore. That matters."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Feels weird saying it out loud, but also like a bit of a relief."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Relief is a good sign. Step 1 doesn’t fix everything, but it gets the weight of denial off your shoulders. That’s where change begins."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Alright. I’m here. I’m listening. Let’s see where this goes."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Perfect. Let’s check back in soon and start exploring Step 2. For now, just notice how it feels to not be carrying the secret alone."}

        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Hi Sam. You've made it to Day 11. That’s something real. Want to talk through Step 2 today?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Sure, but heads up — I still don’t believe in God. I’m not really into faith stuff."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Fair. Step 2 isn’t about believing in any specific god. It's about opening to the idea that something beyond your own willpower might help. Does that idea land at all?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Maybe. Like what — science? Routine? I don’t think there’s anything magical guiding this."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Not magical. Just effective. For some, it’s the program. For others, it’s community. For you, maybe it’s a system that works better than isolation."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I get that. Being part of this and not hiding feels… different. Not spiritual, but grounding."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That counts. You’re already doing it. You’re coming to believe — in the process, in the benefit of showing up, in your own progress."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I still roll my eyes at some of the language though. 'Sanity'? Like I was insane?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Fair reaction. In MA, 'sanity' just means breaking the loop: doing the same thing expecting different results. You’ve said before that you’d quit, then repeat. That’s what we’re pointing to."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Yeah... That definitely happened. I’d throw everything away and buy more two days later."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly. Coming to believe means we start to imagine that maybe — just maybe — a different outcome is possible."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "So it’s not about faith. It’s about pattern-breaking?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Yes. And trusting that something other than your own self-will might help with that — even if it’s this meeting routine, or a mentor, or a habit-tracker app."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Okay, yeah. Those things do help. It’s not spiritual, but it’s something."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Then that’s your Higher Power for now — function, not philosophy."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Alright. So I don’t have to label it or believe in anything specific — just stay open to what’s working?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly. Step 2 is about noticing what’s helping you stay on track, and choosing to lean on that more."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "So far, that’s been structure. And blunt honesty. Yours included."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Then lean into those. You’re not required to believe anything — just to stop insisting your old way was working."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I can admit that. My way sucked. This way at least seems to hold together."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That shift in perspective? That’s Step 2 working. Quiet, skeptical, honest — that counts."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Cool. I’ll keep watching for more evidence. If this step is about building trust in the process, I can work with that."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Perfect. No leap of faith required. Just a willingness to consider something else might work better than going solo."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Alright. I’m open to that. What comes after?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Step 3. But no rush. Sit with this shift for a few days. See how it feels to trust something, even a little."}

        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Totally fine. Step 3 isn’t about theology. It’s about deciding to stop trying to control everything, especially things that haven’t responded to control."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I’m still skeptical, but I can admit — my way was burnout."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly. Step 3 is just a decision to turn over the wheel a little — to something more reliable than chaos or ego."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "What would that be for someone like me?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Could be structure. Routine. A plan that doesn’t rely on how you feel that day. That’s turning your will over to a system that’s steadier than impulses."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "So when I follow my schedule even when I don’t want to — that’s Step 3?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Yes. You’re choosing something smarter than the part of you that craves a shortcut."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Okay, that makes more sense. Still feels weird calling that 'turning my life over.'"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That phrase can be loaded. But it's just about choosing to trust *something* more stable than your urges. Not a surrender — a strategy."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "So I decide to let consistency drive instead of my mood?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly. It’s about being led by a better framework — even if it’s just your calendar and your commitments."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I like that. Feels practical. Doable."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That’s the idea. Step 3 isn’t an emotional leap — it’s a quiet decision to let your recovery plan take priority over the inner chaos."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Alright. Then I’ll say it: I’m choosing the plan over the chaos. I’m done letting my next craving dictate my next move."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That’s a powerful Step 3 statement, Sam. And it’s totally your style — no fluff, just truth."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Thanks. Still don’t believe in God. But I believe in not repeating my mistakes."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That’s all Step 3 needs. You’ve made a decision. You’re not alone in it. Let’s keep building from here, one day at a time."}
