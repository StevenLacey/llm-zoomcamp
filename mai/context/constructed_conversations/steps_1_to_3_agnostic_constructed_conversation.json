        {"sender": "user", "content": "Yeah. I’ve been reading ahead a little. 'Turn our will and lives over'? It sounds kind of... intense."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Totally fair. It can sound like giving up control. But it’s really about choosing to stop trying to control *everything* — especially the stuff we’ve struggled to manage alone."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "So it's more like releasing the grip? Trusting something else to help carry the load?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly. Step 3 doesn’t say 'give your life away' — it says 'make a decision' to trust. That’s a beginning, not an ending."},

        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Not at all. That part of the step is actually an invitation. You get to define what’s meaningful to you — even if it’s a sense of mystery, the group, or the recovery process itself."},

        {"sender": "user", "content": "Yeah. There are moments when I remember I'm not alone in this, and I breathe a little easier. Maybe that’s enough for now."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That’s more than enough. Step 3 is about deciding to *act* from that space — to trust it a little more today than you did yesterday."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I like that. Trust as a decision — not a feeling. Feelings change so much."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Exactly. This step is about intention. You can still have doubts, fears, resistance. But you *decide* to turn things over anyway — not perfectly, just honestly."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "What does 'turning it over' actually look like day-to-day?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Great question. It might mean pausing before reacting. Asking yourself, 'What would the version of me in recovery do?' Or even just breathing and saying, 'I can’t fix this alone right now.'"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "That’s simple but powerful. I’ve definitely tried to fix everything myself for too long."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Most of us have. It’s not about giving up responsibility — it’s about letting go of the illusion that we control outcomes with sheer will."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Yeah. My way hasn’t exactly been working. I can admit that."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That honesty is huge. Step 3 starts with humility — not shame. Big difference."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "I think I’ve confused those in the past. Like, if I can’t do it on my own, I must be failing."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "You're not failing. You're growing. Step 3 invites a new kind of strength — one based on letting go, not holding tighter."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "So it’s not about knowing exactly what I believe, but being willing to live *as if* support is real?"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "Beautifully said. That’s a perfect summary of this step."},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Alright. Then today I decide to turn things over — even if it’s messy, even if I forget. I’m willing."},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That willingness is everything. You’re doing the work. And you’re not alone. Want to write a short version of your own Step 3 intention?"},
        {"sender": "user", "content": "Sure. How about: 'Today I choose to stop controlling everything. I trust that healing is possible — and I don’t have to do it alone.'"},
        {"sender": "ai_sponsor", "content": "That’s perfect. You’ve just worked Step 3 in your own words. Let’s keep practicing that one day at a time."}
