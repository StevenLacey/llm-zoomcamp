      "text": "Many people say that marijuana is not addicting, but this is simply not accurate. People do become addicted to marijuana, just as they do to alcohol, opioids and stimulants. Marijuana addiction differs from these other types of addictions primarily by the outward or social manifestations, but internally, the same pain and anguish exist. Studies show that about 9% of those who use marijuana become addicted to it."

      "text": "Marijuana addiction is much less socially visible than alcoholism or heroin addiction. The unfortunate truth is that the lack of serious, early consequences to marijuana addiction allow for a long, slow decline, often without recognition, resulting in later-stage addiction before the problem is confronted. An individual may wake up years into this chronic illness, without a reasonable understanding of how their life got so far off track. However, isolation from friends and family, loss of interest and lack of participation in those activities that used to bring joy, and the crushing weight of missed opportunities add up."

If you have addiction in your family, especially the immediate family, you are remarkably more likely to develop this disease. If one of your parents has addiction, you are at least six times as likely as those without addiction in the family to develop addiction. It does not matter if the others in the family are addicted to alcohol or cocaine, the risk of addiction to any substance increases with any addiction in the family."

Sexual, emotional and/or physical trauma increase the risk of addiction. Stress itself is a risk factor for addiction and has been found to contribute to relapse."

Addiction research reveals a complex illness often referred to as a bio-psycho-social-spiritual disease because its manifestations undermine all of these aspects of life. We now have a good understanding of the underlying brain pathology that results in addiction."

      "text": "The reward center of the brain is involved in recognizing and responding to rewarding activities and experiences. If we like something, this part of the brain helps us to remember that, and provides the ability to do it again. It is a subconscious area of the brain, characterized primarily by behavioral responses designed to keep us alive. Survival itself is the ultimate function of the reward center. It is also where all drugs of abuse, including marijuana, play their primary role in addiction."

      "text": "Once one crosses the line into addiction the brain is altered in dramatic fashion. Reward center function diminishes during regular use of marijuana, so those activities and experiences one normally finds enjoyable and beneficial are no longer as important. The reward center now recognizes the continued use of marijuana as the priority, even more important than these other rewarding behaviors and drives, including survival. Other interests and activities diminish while a user becomes increasingly focused on marijuana."

Unfortunately, in later stages of addiction people don't really get high anymore. They are basically using to feel normal. The reward system has adjusted to long-term use by limiting its activity, thus they do not have the same strong responses to pleasure and drugs as in the past."

      "text": "Regular, long-term use results in activation of internal stress systems which try to keep brain function normal. These stress systems cause adverse feelings such as anxiety and dysphoria resulting in a fairly negative emotional state which is felt during withdrawal. This negative emotional state becomes much longer lasting and is relieved only by a return to use of marijuana or other drugs, unless the addict stops using altogether and for a substantial period of time, allowing the entire system to return to normal function."

The frontal cortex, where we think things through, plan things out, and alter our behavior to meet our own needs, is the primary part of the brain that is altered. As a result of addiction, the frontal lobes are no longer functioning at full capacity, limiting recognition of the problem and undermining any plans to fix it."

      "text": "Someone addicted to marijuana may notice problems and may consider a plan, but is very unlikely to carry out a reduction in use or an alteration of behavior over the long run. This is partially due to the altered function of the frontal cortex and an inability to fully recognize and carry out such a plan, especially when it means limiting use of something that has become such a priority. Unfortunately, the part of the brain that identifies and helps people deal with problems is also affected by the addiction and the addict can't see the problem for what it is, nor plan an effective way out of it."

This spiritual program of action provides the necessary healing to allow an addict to attain a new life in recovery from marijuana addiction: a life with hope."
