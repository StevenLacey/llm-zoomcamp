### 1. **Define a New Folder Structure**
   - Create a clear directory structure that separates concerns. For example:
     ```
     /project_root
     ├── /src
     │   ├── __init__.py
     │   ├── api.py          # API-related functions
     │   ├── elasticsearch.py # Elasticsearch-related functions
     │   ├── llm.py         # Functions for interacting with the LLM
     │   ├── conversation.py  # Functions for handling conversations
     │   ├── user.py         # User-related functions
     │   └── utils.py        # Utility functions
     ├── /data
     │   ├── users.json
     │   ├── conversations.json
     │   └── ...
     ├── /notebooks
     │   ├── 01b_intake_greeting.ipynb
     │   ├── 02b_initial_conversations.ipynb
     │   ├── 03_rag_prompt_with_elasticsearch_v1.1.ipynb
     │   └── 04_...
     └── /context
         ├── /users
         ├── /conversations
         └── /spiritual_profile
     ```

### 2. **Identify Common Functionality**
   - Review the existing notebooks and identify functions or classes that are repeated across them. For example:
     - Loading users or documents
     - Interacting with the LLM
     - Building prompts
     - Handling conversation history
   - Group these functionalities into logical modules (as suggested in the folder structure).

### 3. **Create Reusable Functions/Classes**
   - Move the identified functions into the appropriate `.py` files in the `src` directory.
   - Ensure that these functions are generic enough to be reused across different notebooks.
   - Consider using classes if you have related functions that share state or behavior.

### 4. **Update Notebooks**
   - In each notebook, import the necessary functions or classes from the new modules.
   - Keep the notebook code focused on the specific tasks they need to perform, using the modular functions for common operations.

### 5. **Testing**
   - After refactoring, ensure that each module is tested independently. You can create a separate test directory or use a testing framework like `pytest`.
   - Run the notebooks to verify that everything works as expected after the refactor.

### 6. **Documentation**
   - Document the purpose of each module and function. This will help future developers (or yourself) understand the codebase better.
   - Consider adding docstrings to functions and classes to explain their parameters and return values.

### 7. **Iterative Refactoring**
   - Refactor one notebook at a time. This will help you manage changes and test functionality incrementally.
   - If you encounter issues, it will be easier to trace them back to a specific change.

### 8. **Version Control**
   - Use version control (like Git) to track changes. This way, you can revert to previous versions if something goes wrong during the refactoring process.

### Conclusion
By following this modular approach, you will create a more maintainable and scalable codebase. It will also make it easier to collaborate with others and integrate new features in the future. Good luck with your refactoring!
