### 1. **Directory Structure**
   - Create a new directory structure that separates concerns. For example:
     ```
     /project_root
     ├── /src
     │   ├── __init__.py
     │   ├── api.py          # For API-related functions
     │   ├── elasticsearch.py # For Elasticsearch-related functions
     │   ├── llm.py         # For LLM-related functions
     │   ├── conversation.py  # For conversation handling
     │   ├── user.py         # For user-related functions
     │   └── utils.py        # For utility functions
     ├── /notebooks
     │   ├── 01b_intake_greeting.ipynb
     │   ├── 02b_initial_conversations.ipynb
     │   ├── 03_rag_prompt_with_elasticsearch_v1.1.ipynb
     │   └── 04_other_notebook.ipynb
     ├── /context
     │   ├── users.json
     │   ├── conversations.json
     │   └── ...
     └── main.py             # Entry point for the application
     ```

### 2. **Identify Common Functionality**
   - Review the existing notebooks and identify common functions, classes, or logic that can be abstracted into reusable modules. For example:
     - **API Calls**: Functions for making API calls to OpenAI can be centralized in `api.py`.
     - **Elasticsearch Operations**: Functions for indexing and searching can be moved to `elasticsearch.py`.
     - **Conversation Handling**: Functions related to building prompts and managing conversation history can go into `conversation.py`.
     - **User Management**: Functions for loading users, getting user details, etc., can be placed in `user.py`.
     - **Utility Functions**: Any helper functions that are used across multiple modules can be placed in `utils.py`.

### 3. **Refactor Code**
   - Start moving the identified functions and classes into their respective modules. Ensure that you maintain the functionality while refactoring.
   - For each notebook, import the necessary functions from the new modules instead of having the code inline.

### 4. **Testing**
   - After refactoring, run tests to ensure that the functionality remains intact. You can create a separate test directory to write unit tests for your modules.
   - Consider using a testing framework like `pytest` to facilitate this.

### 5. **Documentation**
   - Update any documentation to reflect the new structure and usage of the modules. This will help future developers (or yourself) understand the codebase better.

### 6. **Iterative Approach**
   - Since you mentioned moving things over one at a time, take an iterative approach. Refactor one module or notebook at a time, test it, and then move on to the next. This will help you manage changes and catch issues early.

### 7. **Version Control**
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes. This way, you can easily revert if something goes wrong during the refactoring process.

### Conclusion
By following this modular approach, you'll create a more maintainable and scalable codebase. It will also make it easier to collaborate with others and add new features in the future. Good luck with your refactoring!
